	<p>Hi there.. this is my personal page. I work as data scientist at techology centre of DBS Bank in Hyderabad India.
	   I am passionate about data science, computer vision, NLP and IoT techn. I consider myself as ardant Python lover.
	</p>
	
	<p>Academically, I have completed master's signal processing (thesis: Image fusion) from EE Dept., IIT BOMBAY. Currently I am also pursuing for part time PGSSP program at IIIT Hyderabad. Look at my recent assignment in computer vision course where green screen effect was used to create a composite video. This was special for me as it was done in C++ by compiling OpenCV from sources.

Implementation: MATLAB                                                                         Advisor: Prof. V.M. Gadre 
Description: Designing algorithms for fusing visible and IR camera images into single image
-	Devised a method to analyse ringing artefacts occurring in wavelet domain fusion methods
-	Implemented improved fusion algorithm for dehazing scene using visible and near-infrared images
-	Co-authored [research](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7084823) [papers](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7489945) on ghost-removal for multi-exposure fusion process. 
-	Implemented an algorithm for ringing effect compensation in image fusion</li>
